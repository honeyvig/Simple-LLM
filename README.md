# Simple-LLM
To build a local large language model (LLM) while keeping the underlying logic hidden from stakeholders, you'll need to consider a few key aspects:

    Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained model that can be fine-tuned for your specific use case. Models like GPT-2 or smaller variants of GPT-3 can be run locally with proper hardware.

    Environment Setup: You can set up the environment using libraries such as transformers from Hugging Face. Ensure you have enough RAM and a capable GPU for efficient processing.

    Data Privacy: Use a local instance of the model to ensure that the data does not leave your premises, maintaining confidentiality.

    API Development: Consider developing an API to interact with the model, keeping the model logic hidden behind this interface.

    Cost and Timeline: Discuss hardware requirements, model training, and fine-tuning timelines during your consultation.

Here's a basic Python example to get started with running a local model using Hugging Face's transformers:

python

# Install the necessary libraries
# pip install transformers torch

from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

def load_model():
    # Load pre-trained model and tokenizer
    model_name = "gpt2"  # You can choose a smaller variant or a fine-tuned model
    model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
    tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    return model, tokenizer

def generate_text(prompt, model, tokenizer, max_length=100):
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=max_length, num_return_sequences=1)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

def main():
    model, tokenizer = load_model()
    prompt = "Once upon a time"
    generated_text = generate_text(prompt, model, tokenizer)
    print(generated_text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Next Steps:

    Consultation: Schedule a meeting to discuss your project timeline and budget.
    Implementation Plan: Based on your requirements, we can outline a detailed implementation plan.
    Deadline: Ensure that all necessary resources (hardware, data) are in place before the end of November.
